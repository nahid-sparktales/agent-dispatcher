[Quick start](../README.md#quick-start) · [Usage and configuration](usage.md)

Catalog entries below are generated from the repository's canonical sources.
External skills are referenced, not bundled. The MCP registry includes a workspace-tool entry
and an unmaintained server recorded as a warning; its count is not a list of installed integrations.

## Specialist roles and commands

Commands below use Claude Code manual-install names. Plugin users add `agent-dispatcher:`
after the slash. In Codex, use the short role alias after `$agent-dispatcher`: for example,
`/agent-reviewer` becomes `$agent-dispatcher reviewer`.

## Workflow recipes

<!-- recipes:start -->

- **`build-production-ui`** — Design and implement an interface, then prove in a browser that it renders, responds and is reachable.
- **`database-migration`** — Change a live schema without losing data, with the rollback rehearsed before it is needed.
- **`debug-application`** — Reproduce, isolate, fix, and prove the fix with the original reproduction plus a regression test.
- **`investigate-incident`** — Stabilize a system that is failing right now, then hand off the root cause.
- **`research-technical-decision`** — Turn an open technical question into a decision with the evidence and the tradeoffs visible.
- **`review-pull-request`** — Judge a change against its stated intent and the evidence supplied, and say plainly what was not checked.
- **`security-review`** — Find real, reachable security problems and prove the remediation closed them — checked by someone who did not write the fix.
- **`ship-feature`** — Get a feature from request to merged, with the smallest set of specialists the work actually needs.

Recipes are adaptable starting points. Each describes when to use it and what to omit for
smaller tasks. See the [recipe guide](recipes.md).
